You have been given the "group account" spc353_2 to do your project work
for this course. "group accounts" are needed so that you can share files
with your partners easily.

2 email aliases have been setup for your group. Sending email to either
spc353_2@encs.concordia.ca or sp_comp353_2@encs.concordia.ca will send email
to each one of you.

Though you have a group account you do not have to login to it. You have
been added to the "spc353_2" unix group and you can write in the following
directories:


   /groups/s/sp_comp353_2       This directory is where you should cd into
                                and use while working on the project.
                                It is *NOT* available on the web server!


   /www/groups/s/sp_comp353_2   This is the directory where you should place
                                *ALL* the files to be viewable on the web.


You as a user do not have any disk quota on the above directories but the
unix group "spc353_2" does. The above directories have the sgid bit set
(the 's' in 'rws' below) which means that any files or directories created
below these ones will automatically belong to the "spc353_2" group

  permissions     owner       group        location
   drwxrws---    spc353_2   spc353_2      /groups/s/sp_comp353_2
   dr-xrws---    nul-web    spc353_2      /www/groups/s/sp_comp353_2

(The web server initially runs as "nul-web" before switching to "spc353_2".)


If you change the permissions of any directory under these make sure that
the 's' bit is on (use "chmod g+s name_of_subdirectory" to do so). If you
ever get a message that you are over quota please check the permissions of
the directory you are trying to write into.
